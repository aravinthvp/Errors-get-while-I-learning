while i am doing deeplearning pre  requests i am getting this error then i found the solution ,


Step i did,

pip install pandas


ERROR i get :

Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy'
Consider using the `--user` option or check the permissions.


Solution I found from stackoverflow,

pip install --user pandas

likely happends in scipy and numpy library's
